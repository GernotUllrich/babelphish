== DESCRIPTION:

babelphish makes it simple to translate you yaml files into all the languages supported by Google Translate

== USAGE:

Translate the en.yml file into all supported languages:
  babelphish -y ./my/locales/en.yml
  
Translate the en.yml file into all supported languages and overwrite other yml files:
  babelphish -y ./my/locales/en.yml -o

=== Using in your application
Babelphish can be used to translate content programmatically within your application.  Use it thus:

Translate content into a single language:
  from = 'en'
  to = 'es'
  translation = Babelphish::Translator.translate('hello world', to, from)

Translate content into all supported languages at once.  This will return a hash table with the locale as keys (ie 'en', 'es', etc).
  translations = Babelphish::Translator.multiple_translate('hello world', Babelphish::GoogleTranslate::LANGUAGES, self.locale)
  
Here's a more extensive example
  # Translate title and body using Google
  def translate()
    translate_from_locale = 'en'
    title_translations = Babelphish::Translator.multiple_translate(self.title, Babelphish::GoogleTranslate::LANGUAGES, translate_from_locale)
    body_translations = Babelphish::Translator.multiple_translate(self.body, Babelphish::GoogleTranslate::LANGUAGES, translate_from_locale)
    
    Babelphish::GoogleTranslate::LANGUAGES.each do |language|
      self.content_translations.create!(:title => title_translations[language], 
                                        :body => body_translations[language],
                                        :locale => language)
      end
    end
  end
